# Lost update simulator app
A simple app to demonstrate the concurrency issue in a database.

# What is concurrency control? 
Concurrency control is a mechanism in a database management system that allows simultaneous execution of transactions while maintaining ACID properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability. It maintains the integrity, accuracy and reliability of data when multiple users or processes perform read/write operations concurrently. It helps manage issues such as conflicting operations on a shared database, database integrity, and lost or incorrect updates.
